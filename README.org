#+title: org-powerslides

This is my very minimal presentation tool using Org Mode.

"Slides" are simply narrowed Org Mode subtrees with an optional image displayed

This package is so minimalist it doesn't even require using a minor mode - just bind two keys!

* Configuration
     ;; TODO: integrate explanation of slide show stuff including image resizing with
   ;; disabling window-divider-mode and fringe-mode
   ;; use org-tidy-mode to hide PROPERTIES drawer
   ;; include straight-use-package using GitHub repo

* Slides with images setup
  Add "images" property to each level of your outline where you want the image to change.

  Images are displayed in other-window

** Image preparation
   One style I like is to have images take up a 3:4 ratio as in @daveshap's presentations

   To crop your images to this ratio, I use the ImageMagick =convert= command
   #+begin_src bash
     convert dark-siamese-steampunk-cat.webp -gravity center -extent 3:4 dark-siamese-steampunk-cat-3-4.png
   #+end_src
* Alternative packages
  The primary one is Richard Lister's =org-present=
